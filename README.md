# Time-Series-Forecasting
Time series forecasting projects using ARIMA, SARIMA, exponential smoothing, and moving averages to predict 12-month sales for two real-world datasets. Includes model evaluation, RMSE comparison, and future sales prediction with confidence intervals.

Two real-world forecasting projects using statistical and machine learning models to predict 12-month sales for a Shoe Company and a Soft Drinks brand.

üîç About the Project:
This repository showcases comprehensive time series forecasting solutions for two datasets ‚Äî monthly shoe sales and soft drink sales from 1980 to 1995. The goal: forecast the next 12 months and recommend the most accurate predictive model.

üõ† Techniques Used:

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Time Series Decomposition (Additive & Multiplicative)

Stationarity Testing (ADF Test)

Forecasting Models:

Linear Regression

Naive & Average Models

Moving Averages (4, 6, 9 points)

Exponential Smoothing (Simple, Double, Additive, Multiplicative)

ARIMA & SARIMA (Manual and Auto ARIMA)

üìà Results:

Project 1 (Shoe Sales):

Best Model: Manual SARIMA (2,1,1)(1,0,3,12)

RMSE: 47.87

Project 2 (Soft Drinks):

Best Model: Exponential Smoothing (Multiplicative Seasonality)

RMSE: 447.62

üìä Deliverables:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model diagnostics and RMSE comparisons

Forecast visualizations with confidence intervals

Final model recommendations
